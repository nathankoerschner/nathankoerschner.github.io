# Notes Are for Action

Status: jotting this down quickly so I can clear it off my plate (to refine later)

I’ve come to see notes as useful only when they lead to action. I used to enjoy capturing thoughts and storing them in notebooks or apps, but now I avoid that.

In practice, this means keeping a small “queue” of notes—on paper or digitally—that each support some action. It forces me to either do something with them or remove them.
