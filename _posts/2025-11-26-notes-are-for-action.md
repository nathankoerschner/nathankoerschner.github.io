# Notes Are for Action
Status: Writing this down quickly so that I can have it off my plate (to refine later)

I've come to find it useful to hold the view that notes are only useful for action. 
Wheras I used to find it intreaguing to capture my thoughts, and hold them in notebooks and note-apps, I now find myself actively avoiding this.

Concretely, this looks like carrying a "queue" of notes (across paper and digital formats) which each support action in some way. 
This creates a forcing function for me to either act on things or cut them out.
