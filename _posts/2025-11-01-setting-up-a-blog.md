## Setting up a Blog

Today (in the past 10 minutes) I setup this blog. I've been wanting to have a bit more of an outlet for various tidbits I think others would find helpful.
Back in 2019-2021 I would use Twitter for that, but have since deleted my account. In looking to start back up with something like that, I realized I might as well just create a website. The beauty of this is there are no rules!
I used to think of blogging as an activity which required planning, composition, and focused, serious blogging time. My approach here is going to be more in the vein of tweeting than writing essays.

_I set this up using [this very convenient guide](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html)._
