# About Me
I’m a Software Engineer in Asheville, NC. I like working on projects where I get to work on scaling data infrastructure. I most enjoy work for projects with business or lifestyle impact. My academic training was in Pure Mathematics where I focused on complex analysis. In the past, I’ve worked as a writer, account manager, web developer, and math tutor, among many other jobs.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading, e-biking, and being a part of the community at [Urban Dharma NC](https://www.udharmanc.com/).
