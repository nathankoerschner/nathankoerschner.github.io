# About Me

I’m a Software Engineer based in Asheville, NC, with a background in Pure Mathematics and a focus on building software that’s clean, reliable, and genuinely useful. I like working on projects where I can take something complex—data, systems, or processes—and make it simple and scalable.

I like working across the stack, building data pipelines, APIs, and the tools that make them easy to use. I enjoy seeing a project through from idea to implementation, especially when it has a real impact on how people work or understand information.

Before software, I worked in a mix of roles: writer, tutor, web developer, and project manager. Those experiences taught me how to think clearly, communicate well, and solve problems from different angles.

Outside of work, I spend time reading, e-biking around Asheville, and being part of the community at [Urban Dharma NC](https://www.udharmanc.com/)
, where I serve as a board member and communications director.
